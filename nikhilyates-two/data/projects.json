        "overview": "RRT-based path planning algorithm for a robot simulation in 3D space to navigate a maze. Algorithm design and implementation was done in 48 hours with AditJainn. Programming was done in python using the numpy and scipy libraries. A black and white blueprint image of the maze was fed to the system, which produced a set of waypoints and a clear path from origin to goal that our robot used to successfully maneuver the 3D maze in the Gazebo simulation environment.",
